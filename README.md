# Day-Planner

The purpose of this assignment was to utilize a couple of different API's. JQuery, in conjuction with moment.js, to create a day planner by manipulation the Document Object Model. Users are to enter events which will save onto local storage. Past, present, and future events are color-coded.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

```

#### Challenges

Some aspects of this code have yet to be implemented. However, I learned much in the process of using API's. I still end up wanting to default to Javascript. It was still a good practice for the modern day coding.
